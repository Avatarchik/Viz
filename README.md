Viz is a video downloader for Android.

Viz provides a rudimentary browser for video selection, a video gallery, video playback, download resume, a lock screen and more.
 
Viz is currently in pretty bad shape as parsing for a number of the default bookmarks is broken. YouTube is also not supported as Viz used to be in Google Play and YouTube would have caused it to have been kicked off immediately (instead of the 2+ years it survived without Youtube support).
